# Abstract
Vairimorpha (=Nosema) ceranae is a widespread pollinator parasite that commonly infects honeybees and many wild pollinators, including bumblebees. Previous studies have shown that V. ceranae can be transmitted between individuals and among different species through visitation to shared floral resources. However, the relationship between floral visitation behaviors of pollinators in the natural environment and the prevalence of V. ceranae among multiple species has not been explored. To explore this relationship, we analyzed the number and duration of pollinator visits to particular components of squash flowers, including the petals, stamen, and nectary, by capturing videos of pollinator visitation behavior on squash flowers at six farms in southeastern Michigan, USA. We also collected honeybees and bumblebees at each site to determine the prevalence of V. ceranae in each species. Our results showed that honeybee floral visitation behaviors were consistently correlated with greater V. ceranae prevalence in bumblebees, particularly when honeybees had a greater number or duration of contact with both the pollen and nectar of the flower. However, V. ceranae prevalence in honeybees was unaffected by floral visitation behaviors by any pollinator species. These results suggest that honeybee visitation behaviors on shared floral resources may be an important contributor to increased V. ceranae spillover to bumblebees in the field, as honeybees are a highly competent host capable of transmitting the parasite to other hosts. Understanding how the V. ceranae infection risk is influenced by pollinator behavior in the shared floral landscape is critical for reducing pathogen spillover into declining native bee populations.
